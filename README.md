# SSNEXT
I am currently rewriting [SignStealing](https://github.com/n-grubb/signstealing), my suite of fantasy sports tools in React with TypeScript. I'm using Next for a convenient starting point. 

I am switching this project to a React based architecture mostly for fun as I rewrite the code. But also for the stability of the React ecosystem. I ran into some deploy issue in the Vue3 version that I expect to be resolved as I use more battle-tested technologies like Next.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
