workflow: enter your league id for a public league
use the endpoint to build teams in a league
get all player stats thus far
matchup data
use the endpoint to get a list of free agents


what does this allow me to do? 
run analysis on the matchups
build a longer watchlist - notifications? 
hot matchups 
plan txs for the week
